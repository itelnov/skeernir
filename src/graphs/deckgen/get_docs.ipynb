Actually, it only lets you make changes to existing\\npresentations; it’s just that if you start with a presentation that doesn’t\\nhave any slides, it feels at first like you’re creating one from scratch.\\n\\nHowever, a lot of how a presentation looks is determined by the parts that are\\nleft when you delete all the slides, specifically the theme, the slide master,\\nand the slide layouts that derive from the master. Let’s walk through it a step\\nat a time using examples, starting with the two things you can do with\\na presentation, open it and save it.\\n\\n## Opening a presentation[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/presentations.html#opening-a-presentation \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nThe simplest way to get started is to open a new presentation without\\nspecifying a file to open:\\n\\n```\\nfrom pptx import Presentation\\n\\nprs = Presentation()\\nprs.save(\\'test.pptx\\')\\n\\n```\\n\\nThis creates a new presentation from the built-in default template and saves it\\nunchanged to a file named ‘test.pptx’. A couple things to note:\\n\\n* The so-called “default template” is actually just a PowerPoint file that\\n  doesn’t have any slides in it, stored with the installed python-pptx package. It’s\\n  the same as what you would get if you created a new presentation from a fresh\\n  PowerPoint install, a 4x3 aspect ratio presentation based on the “White”\\n  template. Well, except it won’t contain any slides. PowerPoint always adds\\n  a blank first slide by default.\\n* You don’t need to do anything to it before you save it. If you want to see\\n  exactly what that template contains, just look in the ‘test.pptx’ file this\\n  creates.\\n* We’ve called it a *template*, but in fact it’s just a regular PowerPoint file\\n  with all the slides removed. Actual PowerPoint template files (.potx files)\\n  are something a bit different. More on those later maybe, but you won’t need\\n  them to work with python-pptx.\\n\\n### REALLY opening a presentation[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/presentations.html#really-opening-a-presentation \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nOkay, so if you want any control at all to speak of over the final\\npresentation, or if you want to change an existing presentation, you need to\\nopen one with a filename:\\n\\n```\\nprs = Presentation(\\'existing-prs-file.pptx\\')\\nprs.save(\\'new-file-name.pptx\\')\\n\\n```\\n\\nThings to note:\\n\\n* You can open any PowerPoint 2007 or later file this way (.ppt files from\\n  PowerPoint 2003 and earlier won’t work). While you might not be able to\\n  manipulate all the contents yet, whatever is already in there will load and\\n  save just fine. The feature set is still being built out, so you can’t add or\\n  change things like Notes Pages yet, but if the presentation has them python-pptx is\\n  polite enough to leave them alone and smart enough to save them without\\n  actually understanding what they are.\\n* If you use the same filename to open and save the file, python-pptx will obediently\\n  overwrite the original file without a peep. You’ll want to make sure that’s\\n  what you intend.\\n\\n### Opening a ‘file-like’ presentation[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/presentations.html#opening-a-file-like-presentation \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\npython-pptx can open a presentation from a so-called *file-like* object. It can also\\nsave to a file-like object. This can be handy when you want to get the source\\nor target presentation over a network connection or from a database and don’t\\nwant to (or aren’t allowed to) fuss with interacting with the file system. In\\npractice this means you can pass an open file or StringIO/BytesIO stream object\\nto open or save a presentation like so:\\n\\n```\\nf = open(\\'foobar.pptx\\')\\nprs = Presentation(f)\\nf.close()\\n\\n# or\\n\\nwith open(\\'foobar.pptx\\') as f:\\n    source_stream = StringIO(f.read())\\nprs = Presentation(source_stream)\\nsource_stream.close()\\n...\\ntarget_stream = StringIO()\\nprs.save(target_stream)\\n\\n```\\n\\nOkay, so you’ve got a presentation open and are pretty sure you can save it\\nsomewhere later. Next step is to get a slide in there …# Working with Slides[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/slides.html#working-with-slides \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nEvery slide in a presentation is based on a slide layout. Not surprising then\\nthat you have to specify which slide layout to use when you create a new slide.\\nLet’s take a minute to understand a few things about slide layouts that we’ll\\nneed so the slide we add looks the way we want it to.\\n\\n## Slide layout basics[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/slides.html#slide-layout-basics \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nA slide layout is like a template for a slide. Whatever is on the slide layout\\n“shows through” on a slide created with it and formatting choices made on the\\nslide layout are inherited by the slide. This is an important feature for\\ngetting a professional-looking presentation deck, where all the slides are\\nformatted consistently. Each slide layout is based on the slide master in\\na similar way, so you can make presentation-wide formatting decisions on the\\nslide master and layout-specific decisions on the slide layouts. There can\\nactually be multiple slide masters, but I’ll pretend for now there’s only one.\\nUsually there is.\\n\\nThe presentation themes that come with PowerPoint have about nine slide\\nlayouts, with names like *Title*, *Title and Content*, *Title Only*, and\\n*Blank*. Each has zero or more placeholders (mostly not zero), preformatted\\nareas into which you can place a title, multi-level bullets, an image, etc.\\nMore on those later.\\n\\nThe slide layouts in a standard PowerPoint theme always occur in the same\\nsequence. This allows content from one deck to be pasted into another and be\\nconnected with the right new slide layout:\\n\\n* Title (presentation title slide)\\n* Title and Content\\n* Section Header (sometimes called Segue)\\n* Two Content (side by side bullet textboxes)\\n* Comparison (same but additional title for each side by side content box)\\n* Title Only\\n* Blank\\n* Content with Caption\\n* Picture with Caption\\n\\nIn python-pptx, these are `prs.slide_layouts[0]` through `prs.slide_layouts[8]`.\\nHowever, there’s no rule they have to appear in this order, it’s just\\na convention followed by the themes provided with PowerPoint. If the deck\\nyou’re using as your template has different slide layouts or has them in\\na different order, you’ll have to work out the slide layout indices for\\nyourself. It’s pretty easy. Just open it up in Slide Master view in PowerPoint\\nand count down from the top, starting at zero.\\n\\nNow we can get to creating a new slide.\\n\\n## Adding a slide[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/slides.html#adding-a-slide \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nLet’s use the Title and Content slide layout; a lot of slides do:\\n\\n```\\nSLD_LAYOUT_TITLE_AND_CONTENT = 1\\n\\nprs = Presentation()\\nslide_layout = prs.slide_layouts[SLD_LAYOUT_TITLE_AND_CONTENT]\\nslide = prs.slides.add_slide(slide_layout)\\n\\n```\\n\\nA few things to note:\\n\\n* Using a “constant” value like `SLD_LAYOUT_TITLE_AND_CONTENT` is up to you.\\n  If you’re creating many slides it can be handy to have constants defined so\\n  a reader can more easily make sense of what you’re doing. There isn’t a set\\n  of these built into the package because they can’t be assured to be right for\\n  the starting deck you’re using.\\n* `prs.slide_layouts` is the collection of slide layouts contained in the\\n  presentation and has list semantics, at least for item access which is about\\n  all you can do with that collection at the moment. Using `prs` for the\\n  Presentation instance is purely conventional, but I like it and use it\\n  consistently.\\n* `prs.slides` is the collection of slides in the presentation, also has\\n  list semantics for item access, and len() works on it. Note that the method\\n  to add the slide is on the slide collection, not the presentation. The\\n  `add_slide()` method appends the new slide to the end of the collection. At\\n  the time of writing it’s the only way to add a slide, but sooner or later\\n  I expect someone will want to insert one in the middle, and when they post\\n  a feature request for that I expect I’ll add an `insert_slide(idx, ...)`\\n  method.\\n\\n## Doing other things with slides[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/slides.html#doing-other-things-with-slides \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nRight now, adding a slide is the only operation on the slide collection. On the\\nbacklog at the time of writing is deleting a slide and moving a slide to\\na different position in the list. Copying a slide from one presentation to\\nanother turns out to be pretty hard to get right in the general case, so that\\nprobably won’t come until more of the backlog is burned down.\\n\\n## Up next …[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/slides.html#up-next \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nOk, now that we have a new slide, let’s talk about how to put something on\\nit …# Understanding Shapes[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/understanding-shapes.html#understanding-shapes \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nPretty much anything on a slide is a shape; the only thing I can think of that\\ncan appear on a slide that’s not a shape is a slide background. There are\\nbetween six and ten different types of shape, depending how you count. I’ll\\nexplain some of the general shape concepts you’ll need to make sense of how to\\nwork with them and then we’ll jump right into working with the specific types.\\n\\nTechnically there are six and only six different types of shapes that can be\\nplaced on a slide:\\n\\nauto shape\\nThis is a regular shape, like a rectangle, an ellipse, or a block arrow.\\nThey come in a large variety of preset shapes, in the neighborhood of 180\\ndifferent ones. An auto shape can have a fill and an outline, and can\\ncontain text. Some auto shapes have adjustments, the little yellow diamonds\\nyou can drag to adjust how round the corners of a rounded rectangle are for\\nexample. A text box is also an autoshape, a rectangular one, just by default\\nwithout a fill and without an outline.\\npicture\\nA raster image, like a photograph or clip art is referred to as a *picture*\\nin PowerPoint. It’s its own kind of shape with different behaviors than an\\nautoshape. Note that an auto shape can have a picture fill, in which an\\nimage “shows through” as the background of the shape instead of a fill color\\nor gradient. That’s a different thing. But cool.\\ngraphic frame\\nThis is the technical name for the container that holds a table, a chart,\\na smart art diagram, or media clip. You can’t add one of these by itself,\\nit just shows up in the file when you add a graphical object. You probably\\nwon’t need to know anything more about these.\\ngroup shape\\nIn PowerPoint, a set of shapes can be *grouped*, allowing them to be\\nselected, moved, resized, and even filled as a unit. When you group a set of\\nshapes a group shape gets created to contain those member shapes. You can’t\\nactually see these except by their bounding box when the group is\\nselected.\\nline/connector\\nLines are different from auto shapes because, well, they’re linear. Some\\nlines can be connected to other shapes and stay connected when the other\\nshape is moved. These aren’t supported yet either so I don’t know much more\\nabout them. I’d better get to these soon though, they seem like they’d be\\nvery handy.\\ncontent part\\nI actually have only the vaguest notion of what these are. It has something\\nto do with embedding “foreign” XML like SVG in with the presentation. I’m\\npretty sure PowerPoint itself doesn’t do anything with these. My strategy\\nis to ignore them. Working good so far.\\n\\nAs for real-life shapes, there are these nine types:\\n\\n* shape shapes – auto shapes with fill and an outline\\n* text boxes – auto shapes with no fill and no outline\\n* placeholders – auto shapes that can appear on a slide layout or master and\\n  be inherited on slides that use that layout, allowing content to be added\\n  that takes on the formatting of the placeholder\\n* line/connector – as described above\\n* picture – as described above\\n* table – that row and column thing\\n* chart – pie chart, line chart, etc.\\n* smart art – not supported yet, although preserved if present\\n* media clip – video or audio\\n\\n## Accessing the shapes on a slide[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/understanding-shapes.html#accessing-the-shapes-on-a-slide \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nEach slide has a *shape tree* that holds its shapes. It’s called a tree because\\nit’s hierarchical in the general case; a node in the shape tree can be a group\\nshape which itself can contain shapes and has the same semantics as the shape\\ntree. For most purposes the shape tree has list semantics. You gain access to\\nit like so:\\n\\n```\\nshapes = slide.shapes\\n\\n```\\n\\nWe’ll see a lot more of the shape tree in the next few sections.\\n\\n## Up next …[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/understanding-shapes.html#up-next \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nOkay. That should be enough noodle work to get started. Let’s move on to\\nworking with AutoShapes.# Working with AutoShapes[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/autoshapes.html#working-with-autoshapes \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nAuto shapes are regular shape shapes. Squares, circles, triangles, stars,\\nthat sort of thing. There are 182 different auto shapes to choose from. 120\\nof these have adjustment “handles” you can use to change the shape, sometimes\\ndramatically.\\n\\nMany shape types share a common set of properties. We’ll introduce many of\\nthem here because several of those shapes are just a specialized form of\\nAutoShape.\\n\\n## Adding an auto shape[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/autoshapes.html#adding-an-auto-shape \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nThe following code adds a rounded rectangle shape, one inch square, and\\npositioned one inch from the top-left corner of the slide:\\n\\n```\\nfrom pptx.enum.shapes import MSO_SHAPE\\n\\nshapes = slide.shapes\\nleft = top = width = height = Inches(1.0)\\nshape = shapes.add_shape(\\n    MSO_SHAPE.ROUNDED_RECTANGLE, left, top, width, height\\n)\\n\\n```\\n\\nSee the [MSO\\\\_AUTO\\\\_SHAPE\\\\_TYPE](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/enum/MsoAutoShapeType.html#msoautoshapetype) enumeration page for a list of all 182 auto\\nshape types.\\n\\n## Understanding English Metric Units[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/autoshapes.html#understanding-english-metric-units \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nIn the prior example we set the position and dimension values to the\\nexpression `Inches(1.0)`. What’s that about?\\n\\nInternally, PowerPoint stores length values in *English Metric Units* (EMU).\\nThis term might be worth a quick Googling, but the short story is EMU is an\\ninteger unit of length, 914400 to the inch. Most lengths in Office documents\\nare stored in EMU. 914400 has the great virtue that it is evenly divisible by\\na great many common factors, allowing exact conversion between inches and\\ncentimeters, for example. Being an integer, it can be represented exactly\\nacross serializations and across platforms.\\n\\nAs you might imagine, working directly in EMU is inconvenient. To make it\\neasier, python-pptx provides a collection of value types to allow easy\\nspecification and conversion into convenient units:\\n\\n```\\n>>> from pptx.util import Inches, Pt\\n>>> length = Inches(1)\\n>>> length\\n914400\\n>>> length.inches\\n1.0\\n>>> length.cm\\n2.54\\n>>> length.pt\\n72.0\\n>>> length = Pt(72)\\n>>> length\\n914400\\n\\n```\\n\\nMore details are available in the [API documentation for pptx.util](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/util.html#util)\\n\\n## Shape position and dimensions[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/autoshapes.html#shape-position-and-dimensions \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nAll shapes have a position on their slide and have a size. In general,\\nposition and size are specified when the shape is created. Position and size\\ncan also be read from existing shapes and changed:\\n\\n```\\n>>> from pptx.enum.shapes import MSO_SHAPE\\n>>> left = top = width = height = Inches(1.0)\\n>>> shape = shapes.add_shape(\\n>>>     MSO_SHAPE.ROUNDED_RECTANGLE, left, top, width, height\\n>>> )\\n>>> shape.left, shape.top, shape.width, shape.height\\n(914400, 914400, 914400, 914400)\\n>>> shape.left.inches\\n1.0\\n>>> shape.left = Inches(2.0)\\n>>> shape.left.inches\\n2.0\\n\\n```\\n\\n## Fill[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/autoshapes.html#fill \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nAutoShapes have an outline around their outside edge. What appears within\\nthat outline is called the shape’s *fill*.\\n\\nThe most common type of fill is a solid color. A shape may also be filled\\nwith a gradient, a picture, a pattern (like cross-hatching for example), or\\nmay have no fill (transparent).\\n\\nWhen a color is used, it may be specified as a specific RGB value or a color\\nfrom the theme palette.\\n\\nBecause there are so many options, the API for fill is a bit complex. This\\ncode sets the fill of a shape to red:\\n\\n```\\n>>> fill = shape.fill\\n>>> fill.solid()\\n>>> fill.fore_color.rgb = RGBColor(255, 0, 0)\\n\\n```\\n\\nThis sets it to the theme color that appears as ‘Accent 1 - 25% Darker’ in\\nthe toolbar palette:\\n\\n```\\n>>> from pptx.enum.dml import MSO_THEME_COLOR\\n>>> fill = shape.fill\\n>>> fill.solid()\\n>>> fill.fore_color.theme_color = MSO_THEME_COLOR.ACCENT_1\\n>>> fill.fore_color.brightness = -0.25\\n\\n```\\n\\nThis sets the shape fill to transparent, or ‘No Fill’ as it’s called in the\\nPowerPoint UI:\\n\\n```\\n>>> shape.fill.background()\\n\\n```\\n\\nAs you can see, the first step is to specify the desired fill type by calling\\nthe corresponding method on fill. Doing so actually changes the properties\\navailable on the fill object. For example, referencing `.fore_color` on a\\nfill object after calling its `.background()` method will raise an\\nexception:\\n\\n```\\n>>> fill = shape.fill\\n>>> fill.solid()\\n>>> fill.fore_color\\n<pptx.dml.color.ColorFormat object at 0x10ce20910>\\n>>> fill.background()\\n>>> fill.fore_color\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\n  ...\\nTypeError: a transparent (background) fill has no foreground color\\n\\n```\\n\\n## Line[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/autoshapes.html#line \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nThe outline of an AutoShape can also be formatted, including setting its\\ncolor, width, dash (solid, dashed, dotted, etc.), line style (single, double,\\nthick-thin, etc.), end cap, join type, and others. At the time of writing,\\ncolor and width can be set using python-pptx:\\n\\n```\\n>>> line = shape.line\\n>>> line.color.rgb = RGBColor(255, 0, 0)\\n>>> line.color.brightness = 0.5  # 50% lighter\\n>>> line.width = Pt(2.5)\\n\\n```\\n\\nTheme colors can be used on lines too:\\n\\n```\\n>>> line.color.theme_color = MSO_THEME_COLOR.ACCENT_6\\n\\n```\\n\\n`Shape.line` has the attribute `.color`. This is essentially a shortcut\\nfor:\\n\\n```\\n>>> line.fill.solid()\\n>>> line.fill.fore_color\\n\\n```\\n\\nThis makes sense for line formatting because a shape outline is most\\nfrequently set to a solid color. Accessing the fill directly is required, for\\nexample, to set the line to transparent:\\n\\n```\\n>>> line.fill.background()\\n\\n```\\n\\n### Line width[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/autoshapes.html#line-width \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nThe shape outline also has a read/write width property:\\n\\n```\\n>>> line.width\\n9525\\n>>> line.width.pt\\n0.75\\n>>> line.width = Pt(2.0)\\n>>> line.width.pt\\n2.0\\n\\n```\\n\\n## Adjusting an autoshape[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/autoshapes.html#adjusting-an-autoshape \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nMany auto shapes have adjustments. In PowerPoint, these show up as little\\nyellow diamonds you can drag to change the look of the shape. They’re a little\\nfiddly to work with via a program, but if you have the patience to get them\\nright, you can achieve some remarkable effects with great precision.\\n\\n### Shape Adjustment Concepts[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/autoshapes.html#shape-adjustment-concepts \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nThere are a few concepts it’s worthwhile to grasp before trying to do serious\\nwork with adjustments.\\n\\nFirst, adjustments are particular to a specific auto shape type. Each auto\\nshape has between zero and eight adjustments. What each of them does is\\narbitrary and depends on the shape design.\\n\\nConceptually, adjustments are guides, in many ways like the light blue ones you\\ncan align to in the PowerPoint UI and other drawing apps. These don’t show, but\\nthey operate in a similar way, each defining an x or y value that part of the\\nshape will align to, changing the proportions of the shape.\\n\\nAdjustment values are large integers, each based on a nominal value of 100,000.\\nThe effective value of an adjustment is proportional to the width or height of\\nthe shape. So a value of 50,000 for an x-coordinate adjustment corresponds to\\nhalf the width of the shape; a value of 75,000 for a y-coordinate adjustment\\ncorresponds to 3/4 of the shape height.\\n\\nAdjustment values can be negative, generally indicating the coordinate is to\\nthe left or above the top left corner (origin) of the shape. Values can also be\\nsubject to limits, meaning their effective value cannot be outside a prescribed\\nrange. In practice this corresponds to a point not being able to extend beyond\\nthe left side of the shape, for example.\\n\\nSpending some time fooling around with shape adjustments in PowerPoint is time\\nwell spent to build an intuitive sense of how they behave. You also might want\\nto have `opc-diag` installed so you can look at the XML values that are\\ngenerated by different adjustments as a head start on developing your\\nadjustment code.\\n\\nThe following code formats a callout shape using its adjustments:\\n\\n```\\ncallout_sp = shapes.add_shape(\\n    MSO_SHAPE.LINE_CALLOUT_2_ACCENT_BAR, left, top, width, height\\n)\\n\\n# get the callout line coming out of the right place\\nadjs = callout_sp.adjustments\\nadjs[0] = 0.5   # vert pos of junction in margin line, 0 is top\\nadjs[1] = 0.0   # horz pos of margin ln wrt shape width, 0 is left side\\nadjs[2] = 0.5   # vert pos of elbow wrt margin line, 0 is top\\nadjs[3] = -0.1  # horz pos of elbow wrt shape width, 0 is margin line\\nadjs[4] = 3.0   # vert pos of line end wrt shape height, 0 is top\\na5 = adjs[3] - (adjs[4] - adjs[0]) * height/width\\nadjs[5] = a5    # horz pos of elbow wrt shape width, 0 is margin line\\n\\n# rotate 45 degrees counter-clockwise\\ncallout_sp.rotation = -45.0\\n\\n```# Understanding placeholders[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/placeholders-understanding.html#understanding-placeholders \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nIntuitively, a placeholder is a pre-formatted container into which content\\ncan be placed. By providing pre-set formatting to its content, it places many\\nof the formatting choices in the hands of the template designer while\\nallowing the end-user to concentrate on the actual content. This speeds the\\npresentation development process while encouraging visual consistency in\\nslides created from the same template.\\n\\nWhile their typical end-user behaviors are relatively simple, the structures\\nthat support their operation are more complex. This page is for those who\\nwant to better understand the architecture of the placeholder subsystem and\\nperhaps be less prone to confusion at its sometimes puzzling behavior. If you\\ndon’t care why they work and just want to know how to work with them, you may\\nwant to skip forward to the following page [Working with placeholders](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/placeholders-using.html#placeholders-using).\\n\\n## A placeholder is a shape[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/placeholders-understanding.html#a-placeholder-is-a-shape \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nPlaceholders are an orthogonal category of shape, which is to say multiple\\nshape types can be placeholders. In particular, the auto shape (p:sp\\nelement), picture (p:pic element), and graphic frame (p:graphicFrame)\\nshape types can be a placeholder. The group shape (p:grpSp), connector\\n(p:cxnSp), and content part (p:contentPart) shapes cannot be\\na placeholder. A graphic frame placeholder can contain a table, a chart, or\\nSmartArt.\\n\\n## Placeholder types[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/placeholders-understanding.html#placeholder-types \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nThere are 18 types of placeholder.\\n\\nTitle, Center Title, Subtitle, Body\\nThese placeholders typically appear on a conventional “word chart”\\ncontaining text only, often organized as a title and a series of bullet\\npoints. All of these placeholders can accept text only.\\nContent\\nThis multi-purpose placeholder is the most commonly used for the body of\\na slide. When unpopulated, it displays 6 buttons to allow insertion of\\na table, a chart, SmartArt, a picture, clip art, or a media clip.\\nPicture, Clip Art\\nThese both allow insertion of an image. The insert button on a clip art\\nplaceholder brings up the clip art gallery rather than an image file\\nchooser, but otherwise these behave the same.\\nChart, Table, Smart Art\\nThese three allow the respective type of rich graphical content to be\\ninserted.\\nMedia Clip\\nAllows a video or sound recording to be inserted.\\nDate, Footer, Slide Number\\nThese three appear on most slide masters and slide layouts, but do not\\nbehave as most users would expect. These also commonly appear on the Notes\\nMaster and Handout Master.\\nHeader\\nOnly valid on the Notes Master and Handout Master.\\nVertical Body, Vertical Object, Vertical Title\\nUsed with vertically oriented languages such as Japanese.\\n\\n## Unpopulated vs. populated[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/placeholders-understanding.html#unpopulated-vs-populated \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nA placeholder on a slide can be empty or filled. This is most evident with\\na picture placeholder. When unpopulated, a placeholder displays customizable\\nprompt text. A rich content placeholder will also display one or more content\\ninsertion buttons when empty.\\n\\nA text-only placeholder enters “populated” mode when the first character of\\ntext is entered and returns to “unpopulated” mode when the last character of\\ntext is removed. A rich-content placeholder enters populated mode when\\ncontent such as a picture is inserted and returns to unpopulated mode when\\nthat content is deleted. In order to delete a populated placeholder, the\\nshape must be deleted *twice*. The first delete removes the content and\\nrestores the placeholder to unpopulated mode. An additional delete will\\nremove the placeholder itself. A deleted placeholder can be restored by\\nreapplying the layout.\\n\\n## Placholders inherit[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/placeholders-understanding.html#placholders-inherit \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nA placeholder appearing on a slide is only part of the overall placeholder\\nmechanism. Placeholder behavior requires three different categories of\\nplaceholder shape; those that exist on a slide master, those on a slide\\nlayout, and those that ultimately appear on a slide in a presentation.\\n\\nThese three categories of placeholder participate in a property inheritance\\nhierarchy, either as an inheritor, an inheritee, or both. Placeholder shapes\\non masters are inheritees only. Conversely placeholder shapes on slides are\\ninheritors only. Placeholders on slide layouts are both, a possible inheritor\\nfrom a slide master placeholder and an inheritee to placeholders on slides\\nlinked to that layout.\\n\\nA layout inherits from its master differently than a slide inherits from\\nits layout. A layout placeholder inherits from the master placeholder sharing\\nthe same type. A slide placeholder inherits from the layout placeholder\\nhaving the same idx value.\\n\\nIn general, all formatting properties are inherited from the “parent”\\nplaceholder. This includes position and size as well as fill, line, and font.\\nAny directly applied formatting overrides the corresponding inherited value.\\nDirectly applied formatting can be removed be reapplying the layout.\\n\\n## Glossary[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/placeholders-understanding.html#glossary \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nplaceholder shape\\nA shape on a slide that inherits from a layout placeholder.\\nlayout placeholder\\na shorthand name for the placeholder shape on the slide layout from which\\na particular placeholder on a slide inherits shape properties\\nmaster placeholder\\nthe placeholder shape on the slide master which a layout placeholder\\ninherits from, if any.# Working with placeholders[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/placeholders-using.html#working-with-placeholders \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nPlaceholders can make adding content a lot easier. If you’ve ever added a new\\ntextbox to a slide from scratch and noticed how many adjustments it took to\\nget it the way you wanted you understand why. The placeholder is in the right\\nposition with the right font size, paragraph alignment, bullet style, etc.,\\netc. Basically you can just click and type in some text and you’ve got\\na slide.\\n\\nA placeholder can be also be used to place a rich-content object on a slide.\\nA picture, table, or chart can each be inserted into a placeholder and so\\ntake on the position and size of the placeholder, as well as certain\\nof its formatting attributes.\\n\\n## Access a placeholder[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/placeholders-using.html#access-a-placeholder \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nEvery placeholder is also a shape, and so can be accessed using the\\n[`shapes`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/slides.html#pptx.slide.Slide.shapes \"pptx.slide.Slide.shapes\") property of a slide. However, when looking for\\na particular placeholder, the [`placeholders`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/slides.html#pptx.slide.Slide.placeholders \"pptx.slide.Slide.placeholders\") property can make\\nthings easier.\\n\\nThe most reliable way to access a known placeholder is by its\\n`idx` value. The `idx` value of a placeholder\\nis the integer key of the slide layout placeholder it inherits properties\\nfrom. As such, it remains stable throughout the life of the slide and will be\\nthe same for any slide created using that layout.\\n\\nIt’s usually easy enough to take a look at the placeholders on a slide and\\npick out the one you want:\\n\\n```\\n>>> prs = Presentation()\\n>>> slide = prs.slides.add_slide(prs.slide_layouts[8])\\n>>> for shape in slide.placeholders:\\n...     print(\\'%d %s\\' % (shape.placeholder_format.idx, shape.name))\\n...\\n0  Title 1\\n1  Picture Placeholder 2\\n2  Text Placeholder 3\\n\\n```\\n\\n… then, having the known index in hand, to access it directly:\\n\\n```\\n>>> slide.placeholders[1]\\n<pptx.parts.slide.PicturePlaceholder object at 0x10d094590>\\n>>> slide.placeholders[2].name\\n\\'Text Placeholder 3\\'\\n\\n```\\n\\nNote\\n\\nItem access on the placeholders collection is like that of\\na dictionary rather than a list. While the key used above is an integer,\\nthe lookup is on idx values, not position in a sequence. If the provided\\nvalue does not match the idx value of one of the placeholders,\\n`KeyError` will be raised. idx values are not necessarily contiguous.\\n\\nIn general, the `idx` value of a placeholder from a built-in slide\\nlayout (one provided with PowerPoint) will be between 0 and 5. The title\\nplaceholder will always have `idx` 0 if present and any other\\nplaceholders will follow in sequence, top to bottom and left to right.\\nA placeholder added to a slide layout by a user in PowerPoint will receive an\\n`idx` value starting at 10.\\n\\n## Identify and Characterize a placeholder[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/placeholders-using.html#identify-and-characterize-a-placeholder \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nA placeholder behaves differently that other shapes in some ways. In\\nparticular, the value of its [`shape_type`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/shapes.html#pptx.shapes.base.BaseShape.shape_type \"pptx.shapes.base.BaseShape.shape_type\") attribute is\\nunconditionally `MSO_SHAPE_TYPE.PLACEHOLDER` regardless of what type of\\nplaceholder it is or what type of content it contains:\\n\\n```\\n>>> prs = Presentation()\\n>>> slide = prs.slides.add_slide(prs.slide_layouts[8])\\n>>> for shape in slide.shapes:\\n...     print(\\'%s\\' % shape.shape_type)\\n...\\nPLACEHOLDER (14)\\nPLACEHOLDER (14)\\nPLACEHOLDER (14)\\n\\n```\\n\\nTo find out more, it’s necessary to inspect the contents of the placeholder’s\\n[`placeholder_format`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/shapes.html#pptx.shapes.base.BaseShape.placeholder_format \"pptx.shapes.base.BaseShape.placeholder_format\") attribute. All shapes have this\\nattribute, but accessing it on a non-placeholder shape raises `ValueError`.\\nThe [`is_placeholder`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/shapes.html#pptx.shapes.base.BaseShape.is_placeholder \"pptx.shapes.base.BaseShape.is_placeholder\") attribute can be used to determine\\nwhether a shape is a placeholder:\\n\\n```\\n>>> for shape in slide.shapes:\\n...     if shape.is_placeholder:\\n...         phf = shape.placeholder_format\\n...         print(\\'%d, %s\\' % (phf.idx, phf.type))\\n...\\n0, TITLE (1)\\n1, PICTURE (18)\\n2, BODY (2)\\n\\n```\\n\\nAnother way a placeholder acts differently is that it inherits its position\\nand size from its layout placeholder. This inheritance is overridden if the\\nposition and size of a placeholder are changed.\\n\\n## Insert content into a placeholder[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/placeholders-using.html#insert-content-into-a-placeholder \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nCertain placeholder types have specialized methods for inserting content. In\\nthe current release, the picture, table, and chart placeholders have\\ncontent insertion methods. Text can be inserted into title and body\\nplaceholders in the same way text is inserted into an auto shape.\\n\\n### [`PicturePlaceholder.insert_picture()`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/placeholders.html#pptx.shapes.placeholder.PicturePlaceholder.insert_picture \"pptx.shapes.placeholder.PicturePlaceholder.insert_picture\")[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/placeholders-using.html#pictureplaceholder-insert-picture \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nThe picture placeholder has an [`insert_picture()`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/placeholders.html#pptx.shapes.placeholder.PicturePlaceholder.insert_picture \"pptx.shapes.placeholder.PicturePlaceholder.insert_picture\")\\nmethod:\\n\\n```\\n>>> prs = Presentation()\\n>>> slide = prs.slides.add_slide(prs.slide_layouts[8])\\n>>> placeholder = slide.placeholders[1]  # idx key, not position\\n>>> placeholder.name\\n\\'Picture Placeholder 2\\'\\n>>> placeholder.placeholder_format.type\\nPICTURE (18)\\n>>> picture = placeholder.insert_picture(\\'my-image.png\\')\\n\\n```\\n\\nNote\\n\\nA reference to a picture placeholder becomes invalid after its\\n[`insert_picture()`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/placeholders.html#pptx.shapes.placeholder.PicturePlaceholder.insert_picture \"pptx.shapes.placeholder.PicturePlaceholder.insert_picture\") method is called. This is\\nbecause the process of inserting a picture replaces the original p:sp\\nXML element with a new p:pic element containing the picture. Any attempt\\nto use the original placeholder reference after the call will raise\\n`AttributeError`. The new placeholder is the return value of the\\n`insert_picture()` call and may also be obtained from the placeholders\\ncollection using the same idx key.\\n\\nA picture inserted in this way is stretched proportionately and cropped to\\nfill the entire placeholder. Best results are achieved when the aspect ratio\\nof the source image and placeholder are the same. If the picture is taller\\nin aspect than the placeholder, its top and bottom are cropped evenly to fit.\\nIf it is wider, its left and right sides are cropped evenly. Cropping can be\\nadjusted using the crop properties on the placeholder, such as\\n[`crop_bottom`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/placeholders.html#pptx.shapes.placeholder.PlaceholderPicture.crop_bottom \"pptx.shapes.placeholder.PlaceholderPicture.crop_bottom\").\\n\\n### [`TablePlaceholder.insert_table()`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/placeholders.html#pptx.shapes.placeholder.TablePlaceholder.insert_table \"pptx.shapes.placeholder.TablePlaceholder.insert_table\")[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/placeholders-using.html#tableplaceholder-insert-table \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nThe table placeholder has an [`insert_table()`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/placeholders.html#pptx.shapes.placeholder.TablePlaceholder.insert_table \"pptx.shapes.placeholder.TablePlaceholder.insert_table\") method.\\nThe built-in template has no layout containing a table placeholder, so this\\nexample assumes a starting presentation named\\n`having-table-placeholder.pptx` having a table placeholder with idx 10 on\\nits second slide layout:\\n\\n```\\n>>> prs = Presentation(\\'having-table-placeholder.pptx\\')\\n>>> slide = prs.slides.add_slide(prs.slide_layouts[1])\\n>>> placeholder = slide.placeholders[10]  # idx key, not position\\n>>> placeholder.name\\n\\'Table Placeholder 1\\'\\n>>> placeholder.placeholder_format.type\\nTABLE (12)\\n>>> graphic_frame = placeholder.insert_table(rows=2, cols=2)\\n>>> table = graphic_frame.table\\n>>> len(table.rows), len(table.columns)\\n(2, 2)\\n\\n```\\n\\nA table inserted in this way has the position and width of the original\\nplaceholder.

Other shapes can’t. Text is\\nalways manipulated the same way, regardless of its container.\\n\\nText exists in a hierarchy of three levels:\\n\\n* [`Shape.text_frame`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/shapes.html#pptx.shapes.autoshape.Shape.text_frame \"pptx.shapes.autoshape.Shape.text_frame\")\\n* [`TextFrame.paragraphs`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/text.html#pptx.text.text.TextFrame.paragraphs \"pptx.text.text.TextFrame.paragraphs\")\\n* [`_Paragraph.runs`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/text.html#pptx.text.text._Paragraph.runs \"pptx.text.text._Paragraph.runs\")\\n\\nAll the text in a shape is contained in its *text frame*. A text frame has\\nvertical alignment, margins, wrapping and auto-fit behavior, a rotation angle,\\nsome possible 3D visual features, and can be set to format its text into\\nmultiple columns. It also contains a sequence of paragraphs, which always\\ncontains at least one paragraph, even when empty.\\n\\nA paragraph has line spacing, space before, space after, available bullet\\nformatting, tabs, outline/indentation level, and horizontal alignment.\\nA paragraph can be empty, but if it contains any text, that text is contained\\nin one or more runs.\\n\\nA run exists to provide character level formatting, including font typeface,\\nsize, and color, an optional hyperlink target URL, bold, italic, and underline\\nstyles, strikethrough, kerning, and a few capitalization styles like all caps.\\n\\nLet’s run through these one by one. Only features available in the current\\nrelease are shown.\\n\\n## Accessing the text frame[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/text.html#accessing-the-text-frame \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nAs mentioned, not all shapes have a text frame. So if you’re not sure and you\\ndon’t want to catch the possible exception, you’ll want to check before\\nattempting to access it:\\n\\n```\\nfor shape in slide.shapes:\\n    if not shape.has_text_frame:\\n        continue\\n    text_frame = shape.text_frame\\n    # do things with the text frame\\n    ...\\n\\n```\\n\\n## Accessing paragraphs[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/text.html#accessing-paragraphs \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nA text frame always contains at least one paragraph. This causes the process\\nof getting multiple paragraphs into a shape to be a little clunkier than one\\nmight like. Say for example you want a shape with three paragraphs:\\n\\n```\\nparagraph_strs = [\\n    \\'Egg, bacon, sausage and spam.\\',\\n    \\'Spam, bacon, sausage and spam.\\',\\n    \\'Spam, egg, spam, spam, bacon and spam.\\'\\n]\\n\\ntext_frame = shape.text_frame\\ntext_frame.clear()  # remove any existing paragraphs, leaving one empty one\\n\\np = text_frame.paragraphs[0]\\np.text = paragraph_strs[0]\\n\\nfor para_str in paragraph_strs[1:]:\\n    p = text_frame.add_paragraph()\\n    p.text = para_str\\n\\n```\\n\\n## Adding text[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/text.html#adding-text \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nOnly runs can actually contain text. Assigning a string to the `.text`\\nattribute on a shape, text frame, or paragraph is a shortcut method for placing\\ntext in a run contained by those objects. The following two snippets produce\\nthe same result:\\n\\n```\\nshape.text = \\'foobar\\'\\n\\n# is equivalent to ...\\n\\ntext_frame = shape.text_frame\\ntext_frame.clear()\\np = text_frame.paragraphs[0]\\nrun = p.add_run()\\nrun.text = \\'foobar\\'\\n\\n```\\n\\n## Applying text frame-level formatting[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/text.html#applying-text-frame-level-formatting \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nThe following produces a shape with a single paragraph, a slightly wider bottom\\nthan top margin (these default to 0.05”), no left margin, text aligned top, and\\nword wrapping turned off. In addition, the auto-size behavior is set to\\nadjust the width and height of the shape to fit its text. Note that vertical\\nalignment is set on the text frame. Horizontal alignment is set on each\\nparagraph:\\n\\n```\\nfrom pptx.util import Inches\\nfrom pptx.enum.text import MSO_ANCHOR, MSO_AUTO_SIZE\\n\\ntext_frame = shape.text_frame\\ntext_frame.text = \\'Spam, eggs, and spam\\'\\ntext_frame.margin_bottom = Inches(0.08)\\ntext_frame.margin_left = 0\\ntext_frame.vertical_anchor = MSO_ANCHOR.TOP\\ntext_frame.word_wrap = False\\ntext_frame.auto_size = MSO_AUTO_SIZE.SHAPE_TO_FIT_TEXT\\n\\n```\\n\\nThe possible values for `TextFrame.auto_size` and\\n`TextFrame.vertical_anchor` are specified by the enumeration\\n[MSO\\\\_AUTO\\\\_SIZE](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/enum/MsoAutoSize.html#msoautosize) and [MSO\\\\_VERTICAL\\\\_ANCHOR](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/enum/MsoVerticalAnchor.html#msoverticalanchor) respectively.\\n\\n## Applying paragraph formatting[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/text.html#applying-paragraph-formatting \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nThe following produces a shape containing three left-aligned paragraphs, the\\nsecond and third indented (like sub-bullets) under the first:\\n\\n```\\nfrom pptx.enum.text import PP_ALIGN\\n\\nparagraph_strs = [\\n    \\'Egg, bacon, sausage and spam.\\',\\n    \\'Spam, bacon, sausage and spam.\\',\\n    \\'Spam, egg, spam, spam, bacon and spam.\\'\\n]\\n\\ntext_frame = shape.text_frame\\ntext_frame.clear()\\n\\np = text_frame.paragraphs[0]\\np.text = paragraph_strs[0]\\np.alignment = PP_ALIGN.LEFT\\n\\nfor para_str in paragraph_strs[1:]:\\n    p = text_frame.add_paragraph()\\n    p.text = para_str\\n    p.alignment = PP_ALIGN.LEFT\\n    p.level = 1\\n\\n```\\n\\n## Applying character formatting[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/text.html#applying-character-formatting \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nCharacter level formatting is applied at the run level, using the `.font`\\nattribute. The following formats a sentence in 18pt Calibri Bold and applies\\nthe theme color Accent 1.\\n\\n```\\nfrom pptx.dml.color import RGBColor\\nfrom pptx.enum.dml import MSO_THEME_COLOR\\nfrom pptx.util import Pt\\n\\ntext_frame = shape.text_frame\\ntext_frame.clear()  # not necessary for newly-created shape\\n\\np = text_frame.paragraphs[0]\\nrun = p.add_run()\\nrun.text = \\'Spam, eggs, and spam\\'\\n\\nfont = run.font\\nfont.name = \\'Calibri\\'\\nfont.size = Pt(18)\\nfont.bold = True\\nfont.italic = None  # cause value to be inherited from theme\\nfont.color.theme_color = MSO_THEME_COLOR.ACCENT_1\\n\\n```\\n\\nIf you prefer, you can set the font color to an absolute RGB value. Note that\\nthis will not change color when the theme is changed:\\n\\n```\\nfont.color.rgb = RGBColor(0xFF, 0x7F, 0x50)\\n\\n```\\n\\nA run can also be made into a hyperlink by providing a target URL:\\n\\n```\\nrun.hyperlink.address = \\'https://github.com/scanny/python-pptx\\'\\n\\n```# Working with charts[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/charts.html#working-with-charts \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\npython-pptx supports adding charts and modifying existing ones. Most chart types\\nother than 3D types are supported.\\n\\n## Adding a chart[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/charts.html#adding-a-chart \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nThe following code adds a single-series column chart in a new presentation:\\n\\n```\\nfrom pptx import Presentation\\nfrom pptx.chart.data import CategoryChartData\\nfrom pptx.enum.chart import XL_CHART_TYPE\\nfrom pptx.util import Inches\\n\\n# create presentation with 1 slide ------\\nprs = Presentation()\\nslide = prs.slides.add_slide(prs.slide_layouts[5])\\n\\n# define chart data ---------------------\\nchart_data = CategoryChartData()\\nchart_data.categories = [\\'East\\', \\'West\\', \\'Midwest\\']\\nchart_data.add_series(\\'Series 1\\', (19.2, 21.4, 16.7))\\n\\n# add chart to slide --------------------\\nx, y, cx, cy = Inches(2), Inches(2), Inches(6), Inches(4.5)\\nslide.shapes.add_chart(\\n    XL_CHART_TYPE.COLUMN_CLUSTERED, x, y, cx, cy, chart_data\\n)\\n\\nprs.save(\\'chart-01.pptx\\')\\n\\n```\\n\\n![../_images/chart-01.png](./Working with charts — python-pptx 1.0.0 documentation_files/chart-01.webp)\\n\\n## Customizing things a bit[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/charts.html#customizing-things-a-bit \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nThe remaining code will leave out code we’ve already seen and only show\\nimports, for example, when they’re used for the first time, just to keep the\\nfocus on the new bits. Let’s create a multi-series chart to use for these\\nexamples:\\n\\n```\\nchart_data = ChartData()\\nchart_data.categories = [\\'East\\', \\'West\\', \\'Midwest\\']\\nchart_data.add_series(\\'Q1 Sales\\', (19.2, 21.4, 16.7))\\nchart_data.add_series(\\'Q2 Sales\\', (22.3, 28.6, 15.2))\\nchart_data.add_series(\\'Q3 Sales\\', (20.4, 26.3, 14.2))\\n\\ngraphic_frame = slide.shapes.add_chart(\\n    XL_CHART_TYPE.COLUMN_CLUSTERED, x, y, cx, cy, chart_data\\n)\\n\\nchart = graphic_frame.chart\\n\\n```\\n\\n![../_images/chart-02.png](./Working with charts — python-pptx 1.0.0 documentation_files/chart-02.webp)\\n\\nNotice that we captured the shape reference returned by the\\n[`add_chart()`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/shapes.html#pptx.shapes.shapetree.SlideShapes.add_chart \"pptx.shapes.shapetree.SlideShapes.add_chart\") call as `graphic_frame` and then extracted\\nthe chart object from the graphic frame using its\\n[`chart`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/shapes.html#pptx.shapes.graphfrm.GraphicFrame.chart \"pptx.shapes.graphfrm.GraphicFrame.chart\") property. We’ll need the chart reference to get\\nto the properties we’ll need in the next steps. The\\n[`add_chart()`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/shapes.html#pptx.shapes.shapetree.SlideShapes.add_chart \"pptx.shapes.shapetree.SlideShapes.add_chart\") method doesn’t directly return the chart\\nobject. That’s because a chart is not itself a shape. Rather it’s a graphical\\n(DrawingML) object *contained* in the graphic frame shape. Tables work this\\nway too, also being contained in a graphic frame shape.\\n\\n## XY and Bubble charts[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/charts.html#xy-and-bubble-charts \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nThe charts so far use a *discrete* set of values for the independent variable\\n(the X axis, roughly speaking). These are perfect when your values fall into\\na well-defined set of categories. However, there are many cases, particularly\\nin science and engineering, where the independent variable is a continuous\\nvalue, such as temperature or frequency. These are supported in PowerPoint by\\nXY (aka. scatter) charts. A bubble chart is essentially an XY chart where the\\nmarker size is used to reflect an additional value, effectively adding\\na third dimension to the chart.\\n\\nBecause the independent variable is continuous, in general, the series do not\\nall share the same X values. This requires a somewhat different data\\nstructure and that is provided for by distinct [`XyChartData`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/chart-data.html#pptx.chart.data.XyChartData \"pptx.chart.data.XyChartData\") and\\n[`BubbleChartData`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/chart-data.html#pptx.chart.data.BubbleChartData \"pptx.chart.data.BubbleChartData\") objects used to specify the data behind charts of these\\ntypes:\\n\\n```\\nchart_data = XyChartData()\\n\\nseries_1 = chart_data.add_series(\\'Model 1\\')\\nseries_1.add_data_point(0.7, 2.7)\\nseries_1.add_data_point(1.8, 3.2)\\nseries_1.add_data_point(2.6, 0.8)\\n\\nseries_2 = chart_data.add_series(\\'Model 2\\')\\nseries_2.add_data_point(1.3, 3.7)\\nseries_2.add_data_point(2.7, 2.3)\\nseries_2.add_data_point(1.6, 1.8)\\n\\nchart = slide.shapes.add_chart(\\n    XL_CHART_TYPE.XY_SCATTER, x, y, cx, cy, chart_data\\n).chart\\n\\n```\\n\\n![../_images/chart-08.png](./Working with charts — python-pptx 1.0.0 documentation_files/chart-08.webp)\\n\\nCreation of a bubble chart is very similar, having an additional value for each data point that specifies the bubble size:\\n\\n```\\nchart_data = BubbleChartData()\\n\\nseries_1 = chart_data.add_series(\\'Series 1\\')\\nseries_1.add_data_point(0.7, 2.7, 10)\\nseries_1.add_data_point(1.8, 3.2, 4)\\nseries_1.add_data_point(2.6, 0.8, 8)\\n\\nchart = slide.shapes.add_chart(\\n    XL_CHART_TYPE.BUBBLE, x, y, cx, cy, chart_data\\n).chart\\n\\n```\\n\\n![../_images/chart-09.png](./Working with charts — python-pptx 1.0.0 documentation_files/chart-09.webp)\\n\\n## Axes[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/charts.html#axes \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nLet’s change up the category and value axes a bit:\\n\\n```\\nfrom pptx.enum.chart import XL_TICK_MARK\\nfrom pptx.util import Pt\\n\\ncategory_axis = chart.category_axis\\ncategory_axis.has_major_gridlines = True\\ncategory_axis.minor_tick_mark = XL_TICK_MARK.OUTSIDE\\ncategory_axis.tick_labels.font.italic = True\\ncategory_axis.tick_labels.font.size = Pt(24)\\n\\nvalue_axis = chart.value_axis\\nvalue_axis.maximum_scale = 50.0\\nvalue_axis.minor_tick_mark = XL_TICK_MARK.OUTSIDE\\nvalue_axis.has_minor_gridlines = True\\n\\ntick_labels = value_axis.tick_labels\\ntick_labels.number_format = \\'0\"%\"\\'\\ntick_labels.font.bold = True\\ntick_labels.font.size = Pt(14)\\n\\n```\\n\\n![../_images/chart-03.png](./Working with charts — python-pptx 1.0.0 documentation_files/chart-03.webp)\\n\\nOkay, that was probably going a bit too far. But it gives us an idea of the\\nkinds of things we can do with the value and category axes. Let’s undo this\\npart and go back to the version we had before.\\n\\n## Data Labels[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/charts.html#data-labels \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nLet’s add some data labels so we can see exactly what the value for each bar\\nis:\\n\\n```\\nfrom pptx.dml.color import RGBColor\\nfrom pptx.enum.chart import XL_LABEL_POSITION\\n\\nplot = chart.plots[0]\\nplot.has_data_labels = True\\ndata_labels = plot.data_labels\\n\\ndata_labels.font.size = Pt(13)\\ndata_labels.font.color.rgb = RGBColor(0x0A, 0x42, 0x80)\\ndata_labels.position = XL_LABEL_POSITION.INSIDE_END\\n\\n```\\n\\n![../_images/chart-04.png](./Working with charts — python-pptx 1.0.0 documentation_files/chart-04.webp)\\n\\nHere we needed to access a Plot object to gain access to the data labels.\\nA plot is like a sub-chart, containing one or more series and drawn as\\na particular chart type, like column or line. This distinction is needed for\\ncharts that combine more than one type, like a line chart appearing on top of\\na column chart. A chart like this would have two plot objects, one for the\\nseries appearing as columns and the other for the lines. Most charts only\\nhave a single plot and python-pptx doesn’t yet support creating multi-plot charts,\\nbut you can access multiple plots on a chart that already has them.\\n\\nIn the Microsoft API, the name *ChartGroup* is used for this object. I found\\nthat term confusing for a long time while I was learning about MS Office\\ncharts so I chose the name Plot for that object in python-pptx.\\n\\n## Legend[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/charts.html#legend \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nA legend is often useful to have on a chart, to give a name to each series\\nand help a reader tell which one is which:\\n\\n```\\nfrom pptx.enum.chart import XL_LEGEND_POSITION\\n\\nchart.has_legend = True\\nchart.legend.position = XL_LEGEND_POSITION.RIGHT\\nchart.legend.include_in_layout = False\\n\\n```\\n\\n![../_images/chart-05.png](./Working with charts — python-pptx 1.0.0 documentation_files/chart-05.webp)\\n\\nNice! Okay, let’s try some other chart types.\\n\\n## Line Chart[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/charts.html#line-chart \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nA line chart is added pretty much the same way as a bar or column chart, the\\nmain difference being the chart type provided in the `add_chart()` call:\\n\\n```\\nchart_data = ChartData()\\nchart_data.categories = [\\'Q1 Sales\\', \\'Q2 Sales\\', \\'Q3 Sales\\']\\nchart_data.add_series(\\'West\\',    (32.2, 28.4, 34.7))\\nchart_data.add_series(\\'East\\',    (24.3, 30.6, 20.2))\\nchart_data.add_series(\\'Midwest\\', (20.4, 18.3, 26.2))\\n\\nx, y, cx, cy = Inches(2), Inches(2), Inches(6), Inches(4.5)\\nchart = slide.shapes.add_chart(\\n    XL_CHART_TYPE.LINE, x, y, cx, cy, chart_data\\n).chart\\n\\nchart.has_legend = True\\nchart.legend.include_in_layout = False\\nchart.series[0].smooth = True\\n\\n```\\n\\n![../_images/chart-06.png](./Working with charts — python-pptx 1.0.0 documentation_files/chart-06.webp)\\n\\nI switched the categories and series data here to better suit a line chart.\\nYou can see the line for the “West” region is *smoothed* into a curve while\\nthe other two have their points connected with straight line segments.\\n\\n## Pie Chart[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/charts.html#pie-chart \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nA pie chart is a little special in that it only ever has a single series and\\ndoesn’t have any axes:\\n\\n```\\nchart_data = ChartData()\\nchart_data.categories = [\\'West\\', \\'East\\', \\'North\\', \\'South\\', \\'Other\\']\\nchart_data.add_series(\\'Series 1\\', (0.135, 0.324, 0.180, 0.235, 0.126))\\n\\nchart = slide.shapes.add_chart(\\n    XL_CHART_TYPE.PIE, x, y, cx, cy, chart_data\\n).chart\\n\\nchart.has_legend = True\\nchart.legend.position = XL_LEGEND_POSITION.BOTTOM\\nchart.legend.include_in_layout = False\\n\\nchart.plots[0].has_data_labels = True\\ndata_labels = chart.plots[0].data_labels\\ndata_labels.number_format = \\'0%\\'\\ndata_labels.position = XL_LABEL_POSITION.OUTSIDE_END\\n\\n```\\n\\n![../_images/chart-07.png](./Working with charts — python-pptx 1.0.0 documentation_files/chart-07.webp)\\n\\n## Odds & Ends[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/charts.html#odds-ends \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nThis should be enough to get you started with adding charts to your\\npresentation with python-pptx. There are more details in the API documentation for\\ncharts here: [Charts](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/chart.html#chart-api)\\n\\n### About colors[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/charts.html#about-colors \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nBy default, the colors assigned to each series in a chart are the theme\\ncolors Accent 1 through Accent 6, in that order. If you have more than six\\nseries, darker and lighter versions of those same colors are used. While it’s\\npossible to assign specific colors to data points (bar, line, pie segment,\\netc.) for at least some chart types, the best strategy to start with is\\nchanging the theme colors in your starting “template” presentation.# Working with tables[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/table.html#working-with-tables \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nPowerPoint allows text and numbers to be presented in tabular form (aligned\\nrows and columns) in a reasonably flexible way. A PowerPoint table is not\\nnearly as functional as an Excel spreadsheet, and is definitely less powerful\\nthan a table in Microsoft Word, but it serves well for most presentation\\npurposes.\\n\\n## Concepts[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/table.html#concepts \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nThere are a few terms worth reviewing as a basis for understanding PowerPoint\\ntables:\\n\\ntable\\n\\nA table is a matrix of cells arranged in aligned rows and columns. This\\norderly arrangement allows a reader to more easily make sense of relatively\\nlarge number of individual items. It is commonly used for displaying\\nnumbers, but can also be used for blocks of text.\\n\\n[![../_images/table-01.png](./Working with tables — python-pptx 1.0.0 documentation_files/table-01.webp)](./Working%20with%20tables%20%E2%80%94%20python-pptx%201.0.0%20documentation_files/table-01.webp)\\n\\ncell\\n\\nAn individual content “container” within a table. A cell has a text-frame\\nin which it holds that content. A PowerPoint table cell can only contain\\ntext. I cannot hold images, other shapes, or other tables.\\n\\nA cell has a background fill, borders, margins, and several other\\nformatting settings that can be customized on a cell-by-cell basis.\\n\\nrow\\nA side-by-side sequence of cells running across the table, all sharing the\\nsame top and bottom boundary.\\ncolumn\\nA vertical sequence of cells spanning the height of the table, all sharing\\nthe same left and right boundary.\\ntable grid, also cell grid\\nThe underlying cells in a PowerPoint table are strictly regular. In\\na three-by-three table there are nine grid cells, three in each row and\\nthree in each column. The presence of merged cells can obscure portions of\\nthe cell grid, but not change the number of cells in the grid. Access to\\na table cell in python-pptx is always via that cell’s coordinates in the cell\\ngrid, which may not conform to its visual location (or lack thereof) in the\\ntable.\\nmerged cell\\n\\nA cell can be “merged” with adjacent cells, horizontally, vertically, or\\nboth, causing the resulting cell to look and behave like a single cell that\\nspans the area formerly occupied by those individual cells.\\n\\n[![../_images/table-02.png](./Working with tables — python-pptx 1.0.0 documentation_files/table-02.webp)](./Working%20with%20tables%20%E2%80%94%20python-pptx%201.0.0%20documentation_files/table-02.webp)\\n\\nmerge-origin cell\\nThe top-left grid-cell in a merged cell has certain special behaviors. The\\ncontent of that cell is what appears on the slide; content of any “spanned”\\ncells is hidden. In python-pptx a merge-origin cell can be identified with the\\n[`_Cell.is_merge_origin`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/table.html#pptx.table._Cell.is_merge_origin \"pptx.table._Cell.is_merge_origin\") property. Such a cell can report the size of\\nthe merged cell with its [`span_height`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/table.html#pptx.table._Cell.span_height \"pptx.table._Cell.span_height\") and [`span_width`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/table.html#pptx.table._Cell.span_width \"pptx.table._Cell.span_width\")\\nproperties, and can be “unmerged” back to its underlying grid cells using\\nits [`split()`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/table.html#pptx.table._Cell.split \"pptx.table._Cell.split\") method.\\nspanned-cell\\nA grid-cell other than the merge-origin cell that is “occupied” by a merged\\ncell is called a *spanned cell*. Intuitively, the merge-origin cell “spans”\\nthe other grid cells within its area. A spanned cell can be identified with\\nits [`_Cell.is_spanned`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/table.html#pptx.table._Cell.is_spanned \"pptx.table._Cell.is_spanned\") property. A merge-origin cell is not itself\\na spanned cell.\\n\\n## Adding a table[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/table.html#adding-a-table \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nThe following code adds a 3-by-3 table in a new presentation:\\n\\n```\\n>>> from pptx import Presentation\\n>>> from pptx.util import Inches\\n\\n>>> # ---create presentation with 1 slide---\\n>>> prs = Presentation()\\n>>> slide = prs.slides.add_slide(prs.slide_layouts[5])\\n\\n>>> # ---add table to slide---\\n>>> x, y, cx, cy = Inches(2), Inches(2), Inches(4), Inches(1.5)\\n>>> shape = slide.shapes.add_table(3, 3, x, y, cx, cy)\\n\\n>>> shape\\n<pptx.shapes.graphfrm.GraphicFrame object at 0x1022816d0>\\n>>> shape.has_table\\nTrue\\n>>> table = shape.table\\n>>> table\\n<pptx.table.Table object at 0x1096f8d90>\\n\\n```\\n\\n[![../_images/table-03.png](./Working with tables — python-pptx 1.0.0 documentation_files/table-03.webp)](./Working%20with%20tables%20%E2%80%94%20python-pptx%201.0.0%20documentation_files/table-03.webp)\\n\\nA couple things to note:\\n\\n* [`SlideShapes.add_table()`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/shapes.html#pptx.shapes.shapetree.SlideShapes.add_table \"pptx.shapes.shapetree.SlideShapes.add_table\") returns a shape that contains the table, not\\n  the table itself. In PowerPoint, a table is contained in a graphic-frame\\n  shape, as is a chart or SmartArt. You can determine whether a shape\\n  contains a table using its [`has_table`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/shapes.html#pptx.shapes.base.BaseShape.has_table \"pptx.shapes.base.BaseShape.has_table\") property and you\\n  access the table object using the shape’s [`table`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/shapes.html#pptx.shapes.graphfrm.GraphicFrame.table \"pptx.shapes.graphfrm.GraphicFrame.table\")\\n  property.\\n\\n## Inserting a table into a table placeholder[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/table.html#inserting-a-table-into-a-table-placeholder \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nA placeholder allows you to specify the position and size of a shape as part\\nof the presentation “template”, and to place a shape of your choosing into\\nthat placeholder when authoring a presentation based on that template. This\\ncan lead to a better looking presentation, with objects appearing in\\na consistent location from slide-to-slide.\\n\\nPlaceholders come in different types, one of which is a *table placeholder*.\\nA table placeholder behaves like other placeholders except it can only accept\\ninsertion of a table. Other placeholder types accept text bullets or charts.\\n\\nThere is a subtle distinction between a *layout placeholder* and a *slide\\nplaceholder*. A layout placeholder appears in a slide layout, and defines the\\nposition and size of the placeholder “cloned” from it onto each slide created\\nwith that layout. As long as you don’t adjust the position or size of the\\nslide placeholder, it will inherit it’s position and size from the layout\\nplaceholder it derives from.\\n\\nTo insert a table into a table placeholder, you need a slide layout that\\nincludes a table placeholder, and you need to create a slide using that\\nlayout. These examples assume that the third slide layout in template.pptx\\nincludes a table placeholder:\\n\\n```\\n>>> prs = Presentation(\\'template.pptx\\')\\n>>> slide = prs.slides.add_slide(prs.slide_layouts[2])\\n\\n```\\n\\n*Accessing the table placeholder.* Generally, the easiest way to access\\na placeholder shape is to know its position in the slide.shapes collection.\\nIf you always use the same template, it will always show up in the same\\nposition:\\n\\n```\\n>>> table_placeholder = slide.shapes[1]\\n\\n```\\n\\n*Inserting a table.* A table is inserted into the placeholder by calling its\\n[`insert_table()`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/placeholders.html#pptx.shapes.placeholder.TablePlaceholder.insert_table \"pptx.shapes.placeholder.TablePlaceholder.insert_table\") method and providing the desired\\nnumber of rows and columns:\\n\\n```\\n>>> shape = table_placeholder.insert_table(rows=3, cols=4)\\n\\n```\\n\\nThe return value is a [`GraphicFrame`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/shapes.html#pptx.shapes.graphfrm.GraphicFrame \"pptx.shapes.graphfrm.GraphicFrame\") shape containing the new table, not the\\ntable object itself. Use the [`table`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/shapes.html#pptx.shapes.graphfrm.GraphicFrame.table \"pptx.shapes.graphfrm.GraphicFrame.table\") property of that\\nshape to access the table object:\\n\\n```\\n>>> table = shape.table\\n\\n```\\n\\nThe containing shape controls the position and size. Everything else, like\\naccessing cells and their contents, is done from the table object.\\n\\n## Accessing a cell[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/table.html#accessing-a-cell \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nAll content in a table is in a cell, so getting a reference to one of those\\nis a good place to start:\\n\\n```\\n>>> cell = table.cell(0, 0)\\n>>> cell.text\\n\\'\\'\\n>>> cell.text = \\'Unladen Swallow\\'\\n\\n```\\n\\n[![../_images/table-04.png](./Working with tables — python-pptx 1.0.0 documentation_files/table-04.webp)](./Working%20with%20tables%20%E2%80%94%20python-pptx%201.0.0%20documentation_files/table-04.webp)\\n\\nThe cell is specified by its row, column coordinates as zero-based offsets.\\nThe top-left cell is at row, column (0, 0).\\n\\nLike an auto-shape, a cell has a text-frame and can contain arbitrary text\\ndivided into paragraphs and runs. Any desired character formatting can be\\napplied individually to each run.\\n\\nOften however, cell text is just a simple string. For these cases the\\nread/write [`_Cell.text`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/table.html#pptx.table._Cell.text \"pptx.table._Cell.text\") property can be the quickest way to set cell\\ncontents.\\n\\n## Merging cells[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/table.html#merging-cells \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nA merged cell is produced by specifying two diagonal cells. The merged cell\\nwill occupy all the grid cells in the rectangular region specified by that\\ndiagonal:\\n\\n[![../_images/table-05.png](./Working with tables — python-pptx 1.0.0 documentation_files/table-05.webp)](./Working%20with%20tables%20%E2%80%94%20python-pptx%201.0.0%20documentation_files/table-05.webp)\\n```\\n>>> cell = table.cell(0, 0)\\n>>> other_cell = table.cell(1, 1)\\n>>> cell.is_merge_origin\\nFalse\\n>>> cell.merge(other_cell)\\n>>> cell.is_merge_origin\\nTrue\\n>>> cell.is_spanned\\nFalse\\n>>> other_cell.is_spanned\\nTrue\\n>>> table.cell(0, 1).is_spanned\\nTrue\\n\\n```\\n\\n[![../_images/table-06.png](./Working with tables — python-pptx 1.0.0 documentation_files/table-06.webp)](./Working%20with%20tables%20%E2%80%94%20python-pptx%201.0.0%20documentation_files/table-06.webp)\\n\\nA few things to observe:\\n\\n* The merged cell appears as a single cell occupying the space formerly\\n  occupied by the other grid cells in the specified rectangular region.\\n* The formatting of the merged cell (background color, font etc.) is taken\\n  from the merge origin cell, the top-left cell of the table in this case.\\n* Content from the merged cells was migrated to the merge-origin cell. That\\n  content is no longer present in the spanned grid cells (although you can’t\\n  see those at the moment). The content of each cell appears as a separate\\n  paragraph in the merged cell; it isn’t concatenated into a single\\n  paragraph. Content is migrated in left-to-right, top-to-bottom order of the\\n  original cells.\\n* Calling `other_cell.merge(cell)` would have the exact same effect. The\\n  merge origin is always the top-left cell in the specified rectangular\\n  region. There are four distinct ways to specify a given rectangular region\\n  (two diagonals, each having two orderings).\\n\\n## Un-merging a cell[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/table.html#un-merging-a-cell \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nA merged cell can be restored to its underlying grid cells by calling the\\n[`split()`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/table.html#pptx.table._Cell.split \"pptx.table._Cell.split\") method on its merge-origin cell. Calling\\n[`split()`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/table.html#pptx.table._Cell.split \"pptx.table._Cell.split\") on a cell that is not a merge-origin raises\\n`ValueError`:\\n\\n```\\n>>> cell = table.cell(0, 0)\\n>>> cell.is_merge_origin\\nTrue\\n>>> cell.split()\\n>>> cell.is_merge_origin\\nFalse\\n>>> table.cell(0, 1).is_spanned\\nFalse\\n\\n```\\n\\n[![../_images/table-07.png](./Working with tables — python-pptx 1.0.0 documentation_files/table-07.webp)](./Working%20with%20tables%20%E2%80%94%20python-pptx%201.0.0%20documentation_files/table-07.webp)\\n\\nNote that the content migration performed as part of the .merge() operation\\nwas not reversed.\\n\\n## A few snippets that might be handy[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/table.html#a-few-snippets-that-might-be-handy \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nUse Case: Interrogate table for merged cells:\\n\\n```\\ndef iter_merge_origins(table):\\n    \"\"\"Generate each merge-origin cell in *table*.\\n\\n    Cell objects are ordered by their position in the table,\\n    left-to-right, top-to-bottom.\\n    \"\"\"\\n    return (cell for cell in table.iter_cells() if cell.is_merge_origin)\\n\\ndef merged_cell_report(cell):\\n    \"\"\"Return str summarizing position and size of merged *cell*.\"\"\"\\n    return (\\n        \\'merged cell at row %d, col %d, %d cells high and %d cells wide\\'\\n        % (cell.row_idx, cell.col_idx, cell.span_height, cell.span_width)\\n    )\\n\\n# ---Print a summary line for each merged cell in *table*.---\\nfor merge_origin_cell in iter_merge_origins(table):\\n    print(merged_cell_report(merge_origin_cell))\\n\\n```\\n\\nprints a report like:\\n\\n```\\nmerged cell at row 0, col 0, 2 cells high and 2 cells wide\\nmerged cell at row 3, col 2, 1 cells high and 2 cells wide\\nmerged cell at row 4, col 0, 2 cells high and 1 cells wide\\n\\n```\\n\\nUse Case: Access only cells that display text (are not spanned):\\n\\n```\\ndef iter_visible_cells(table):\\n    return (cell for cell in table.iter_cells() if not cell.is_spanned)\\n\\n```\\n\\nUse Case: Determine whether table contains merged cells:\\n\\n```\\ndef has_merged_cells(table):\\n    for cell in table.iter_cells():\\n        if cell.is_merge_origin:\\n            return True\\n    return False\\n\\n```# Working with Notes Slides[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/notes.html#working-with-notes-slides \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nA slide can have notes associated with it. These are perhaps most commonly\\nencountered in the notes pane, below the slide in PowerPoint “Normal” view\\nwhere it may say “Click to add notes”.\\n\\nThe notes added here appear each time that slide is present in the main pane.\\nThey also appear in *Presenter View* and in *Notes Page* view, both available\\nfrom the menu.\\n\\nNotes can contain rich text, commonly bullets, bold, varying font sizes and\\ncolors, etc. The Notes Page view has somewhat more powerful tools for editing\\nthe notes text than the note pane in Normal view.\\n\\nIn the API and the underlying XML, the object that contains the text is known\\nas a *Notes Slide*. This is because internally, a notes slide is actually\\na specialized instance of a slide. It contains shapes, many of which are\\nplaceholders, and allows inserting of new shapes such as pictures (a logo\\nperhaps) auto shapes, tables, and charts. Consequently, working with a notes\\nslide is very much like working with a regular slide.\\n\\nEach slide can have zero or one notes slide. A notes slide is created the\\nfirst time it is used, generally perhaps by adding notes text to a slide.\\nOnce created, it stays, even if all the text is deleted.\\n\\n## The Notes Master[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/notes.html#the-notes-master \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nA new notes slide is created using the *Notes Master* as a template.\\nA presentation has no notes master when newly created in PowerPoint. One is\\ncreated according to a PowerPoint-internal preset default the first time it\\nis needed, which is generally when the first notes slide is created. It’s\\npossible one can also be created by entering the Notes Master view and almost\\ncertainly is created by editing the master found there (haven’t tried it\\nthough). A presentation can have at most one notes master.\\n\\nThe notes master governs the look and feel of notes pages, which can be\\nviewed on-screen but are really designed for printing out. So if you want\\nyour notes page print-outs to look different from the default, you can make\\na lot of customizations by editing the notes master. You access the notes\\nmaster editor using View > Master > Notes Master on the menu (on my version\\nat least). Notes slides created using python-pptx will have the look and feel of the\\nnotes master in the presentation file you opened to create the presentation.\\n\\nOn creation, certain placeholders (slide image, notes, slide number) are\\ncopied from the notes master onto the new notes slide (if they have not been\\nremoved from the master). These “cloned” placeholders inherit position, size,\\nand formatting from their corresponding notes master placeholder. If the\\nposition, size, or formatting of a notes slide placeholder is changed, the\\nchanged property is no long inherited (unchanged properties, however,\\ncontinue to be inherited).\\n\\n## Notes Slide basics[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/notes.html#notes-slide-basics \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nEnough talk, let’s show some code. Let’s say you have a slide you’re working\\nwith and you want to see if it has a notes slide yet:\\n\\n```\\n>>> slide.has_notes_slide\\nFalse\\n\\n```\\n\\nOk, not yet. Good. Let’s add some notes:\\n\\n```\\n>>> notes_slide = slide.notes_slide\\n>>> text_frame = notes_slide.notes_text_frame\\n>>> text_frame.text = \\'foobar\\'\\n\\n```\\n\\nAlright, simple enough. Let’s look at what happened here:\\n\\n* `slide.notes_slide` gave us the notes slide. In this case, it first\\n  created that notes slide based on the notes master. If there was no notes\\n  master, it created that too. So a lot of things can happen behind the\\n  scenes with this call the first time you call it, but if we called it again\\n  it would just give us back the reference to the same notes slide, which it\\n  caches, once retrieved.\\n* `notes_slide.notes_text_frame` gave us the [`TextFrame`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/text.html#pptx.text.text.TextFrame \"pptx.text.text.TextFrame\") object that\\n  contains the actual notes. The reason it’s not just\\n  `notes_slide.text_frame` is that there are potentially more than one. What\\n  this is doing behind the scenes is finding the placeholder shape that\\n  contains the notes (as opposed to the slide image, header, slide number,\\n  etc.) and giving us *that* particular text frame.\\n* A text frame in a notes slide works the same as one in a regular slide.\\n  More precisely, a text frame on a shape in a notes slide works the same as\\n  in any other shape. We used the `.text` property to quickly pop some text\\n  in there.\\n\\nUsing the text frame, you can add an arbitrary amount of text, formatted\\nhowever you want.\\n\\n## Notes Slide Placeholders[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/notes.html#notes-slide-placeholders \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nWhat we haven’t explicitly seen so far is the shapes on a slide master. It’s\\neasy to get started with that:\\n\\n```\\n>>> notes_placeholder = notes_slide.notes_placeholder\\n\\n```\\n\\nThis notes placeholder is just like a body placeholder we saw a couple\\nsections back. You can change its position, size, and many other attributes,\\nas well as get at its text via its text frame.\\n\\nYou can also access the other placeholders:\\n\\n```\\n>>> for placeholder in notes_slide.placeholders:\\n...   print placeholder.placeholder_format.type\\n...\\nSLIDE_IMAGE (101)\\nBODY (2)\\nSLIDE_NUMBER (13)\\n\\n```\\n\\nand also the shapes (a superset of the placeholders):\\n\\n```\\n>>> for shape in notes_slide.shapes:\\n...   print shape\\n...\\n<pptx.shapes.placeholder.NotesSlidePlaceholder object at 0x11091e890>\\n<pptx.shapes.placeholder.NotesSlidePlaceholder object at 0x11091e750>\\n<pptx.shapes.placeholder.NotesSlidePlaceholder object at 0x11091e990>\\n\\n```\\n\\nIn the common case, the notes slide contains only placeholders. However, if\\nyou added an image, for example, to the notes slide, that would show up as\\nwell. Note that if you added that image to the notes master, perhaps a logo,\\nit would appear on the notes slide “visually”, but would not appear as\\na shape in the notes slide shape collection. Rather, it is visually\\n“inherited” from the notes master.# Concepts[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/concepts.html#concepts \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\npython-pptx is completely object-oriented, and in general any operations you perform\\nwith it will be on an object. The root object for a presentation is\\n[`Presentation`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/presentation.html#pptx.presentation.Presentation \"pptx.presentation.Presentation\"). API details are provided on the modules pages, but here are\\nsome basics to get you started, especially some relationships you might find\\nsurprising at first.\\n\\nA presentation is loaded by constructing a new [`Presentation`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/presentation.html#pptx.presentation.Presentation \"pptx.presentation.Presentation\") instance,\\npassing in the path to a presentation to be loaded:\\n\\n```\\nfrom pptx import Presentation\\n\\npath = \\'slide-deck-foo.pptx\\'\\nprs = Presentation(path)\\n\\n```\\n\\npython-pptx also contains a default template, and if you construct a [`Presentation`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/presentation.html#pptx.presentation.Presentation \"pptx.presentation.Presentation\")\\ninstance without a path, a presentation based on that default template is\\nloaded. This can be handy when you want to get started quickly, and most of the\\nexamples in this documentation use the default template.:\\n\\n```\\n# start with default presentation\\nprs = Presentation()\\n\\n```\\n\\nNote that there is currently no distinction between templates and presentations\\nin python-pptx as there is in the PowerPoint® client, there are only presentations. To\\nuse a “template” for a presentation you simply create a presentation with all\\nthe styles, logo, and layouts you want, delete all the slides (or leave some in\\nif it suits), and then load that as your starting place.\\n\\n## Slide masters[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/concepts.html#slide-masters \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nA presentation has a list of slide masters and a list of slides. Let’s start\\nwith a discussion of the slide masters.\\n\\nOne fact some find surprising (I did) is that a presentation file can have\\nmore than one slide master. It’s quite uncommon in my experience to find\\npresentations that make use of this feature, but it’s entirely supported. The\\nonly time I’ve seen this happen is when slides from a “foreign” presentation\\nare pasted into another deck; if you want the formatting and backgrounds from\\nthe other deck to be preserved on the pasted-in slides, the slide master and\\nits slide layouts need to come with. Consequently, the presentation needs to\\nmaintain a list of slide masters, not just a single one, even though perhaps\\n99% of the time you only ever use the one. To make things a little easier for\\nthe 99% situation, you can refer to the first slide master as though it were\\nthe only one:\\n\\n```\\nprs = Presentation()\\nslide_master = prs.slide_masters[0]\\n# is equivalent to\\nslide_master = prs.slide_master\\n\\n```\\n\\n## Slide layouts[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/concepts.html#slide-layouts \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nAnother fact that might be surprising is that slide layouts belong to a slide\\nmaster, not directly to a presentation, so normally you have to access the\\nslide layouts via their slide master. Since this is subject to the same 99%\\nsituation described above, the slide layouts belonging to the first slide\\nmaster can also be accessed directly from the presentation via syntactic\\nsugar:\\n\\n```\\nprs = Presentation()\\ntitle_slide_layout = prs.slide_masters[0].slide_layouts[0]\\n# is equivalent to:\\ntitle_slide_layout = prs.slide_layouts[0]\\n\\n```\\n\\n## Slides[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/concepts.html#slides \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nThe slides in a presentation belong to the presentation object and are\\naccessed using the `slides` attribute:\\n\\n```\\nprs = Presentation(path)\\nfirst_slide = prs.slides[0]\\n\\n```\\n\\n### Adding a slide[¶](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/concepts.html#adding-a-slide \"Permalink to this headline\")\\n\\nAdding a slide is accomplished by calling the `add_slide()` method on the\\n`slides` attribute of the presentation. A slide layout must be passed\\nin to specify the layout the new slide should take on:\\n\\n```\\nprs = Presentation()\\ntitle_slide_layout = prs.slide_layouts[0]\\nnew_slide = prs.slides.add_slide(title_slide_layout)\\n\\n```'"
